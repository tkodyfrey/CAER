# Public Speaking Questionnaire

Let's go over your responses...

## Speaking Experiences

## Comfort Level

## Example Fears

## Feelings

## Career Plans

## The Result?

## Comparison

## What does this tell me?

## Our goals

1.  **Tackling Anxiety and Apprehension**
    -   Understanding fears and learning to manage them
2.  **Defining the Donut**
    -   Defining your objective and actively preparing
3.  **Presenting as Performance**
    -   Developing your identity as a speaker and handling Q&A

# Tackling Anxiety and Apprehension

Understanding fears and learning to manage them

# Preparing with Donuts

## Situating the Talk

"According to most studies, people's number one fear is public speaking. Number two is death. Death is number two? Does that seem right? To the average person that means that if they have to go to a funeral, they'd be better off in the casket than giving the eulogy."

-   Jerry Seinfeld

## What is *Communication Apprehension*?

Defined as "a situation- specific social anxiety that arises from the real or anticipated enactment of an oral presentation" (Bodie, 2010, p. 72)

## Where does it come from?

::: panel-tabset
### Hereditary

Often manifests due to the presence of certain traits like a speech impediment or monotoned voice.

In 7th grade, my classmates called me 'Lispy'!

### Learned

We become socialized into fearing certain situations, audiences, or contexts.

EX: Meeting your partners parents for the first time??

### Skills Deficit

Uncertainty resulting from how to effectively communication or analyze an audience.

AKA many of us are never taught how to speak!

## When does it affect us?

## Effects {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Internal Effects

-   Physiological
-   Often unknown to audience but known to speaker

External Effects

-   Behavioral
-   Often unknown to speaker but visible to audience

## Strategies for managing apprehension {.smaller}

::: panel-tabset
### Desensitization

Densensitization helps you become comfortable

Allows you to embrace nerves rather than retreat

![](images/strat1.png){.absolute top="280" left="700" width="300"}

### Restructuring

Ask yourself why this fear is irrational

Think of what you have done to eliminate it

![](images/strat2.png){.absolute top="280" left="700" width="300"}

### Visualization

Picture yourself being successful

Manifests as self-fulfilling prophecy

![](images/strat3.png){.absolute top="280" left="700" width="300"}

### Skills Training

Remember the training you have received

Classes, experiences, and mentors

# Preparing with *Donuts*

*Defining your objective and actively preparing*

## Planning Your Story {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Step 1: Consider the donut**

If the donut is your field, the hole is the gap you're trying to fill.

-   Your research question(s)
-   Motivate audience to listen
-   *Focus on what we do not know*

## Planning Your Story {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Step 2: Analyze your audience**

Consider the following questions:

-   What do they already know?
-   Are they required to be here?
-   What do we have in common?
-   What do they want to know
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Step 3: Identify your throughline**

What is the invisible thread that binds your story together?

-   The scientific method
-   A central question
-   An area of study
-   A conference theme?
:::
:::

## Planning Your Story

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Step 4: Analyze Your audience**

Use *analogies* and little jargon

-   After assessing your audience and identifying your throughline, you can choose language that is appropriate.
-   Avoid specialized language and use terms that are familiar.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Step 5: End with a clear conclusion**

You should always:

-   Identify what we know now that we did not know before.
-   Articulate where the research goes next.
-   Make it memorable!

## Complex Topics

![](images/complex.png){fig-align="center"}

## You Try

Think of a research project or topic you are interested in.

**How would you explain this to a group of 2 to 4 year olds?**

## Quantum Physics...for babies?

Chris Ferrie - PhD in Applied Mathematics

Topics range across:

-   General relatively
-   Bayesian statistics
-   Electromagnetism
-   Robotics
-   Neural networks

## Baby University

What specific strategies do the books take to explain their subject matter?

Are they effective? Why or why not?

## The Hourglass

BE SELECTIVE in your details.

-   Highlight critical information
-   Avoid overwhelming listeners
-   Keep literature review to a minimum

# Presenting as *Performance*

Developing your identity as a speaker

## Roots in identity

View your talk as a performance of your identity.

It takes time, preparation, and practice to *convey the image you want* to the audience.

## Delivery

Remember that *energy does not equal* effectiveness.

-   Match your nonverbals to your tone.
-   Make eye contact with both sides of the room.
-   Stand to engage the audience.
-   Avoid self-handicapping.
-   Practice with keywords.
-   Take a chance!

## Delivery

The audience does not want to be bored.

Utilize *immediacy* and *speaking to them directly* is engaging.

Attempting to engage with them grants you more leniency for mistakes.

## Visual Aids

The visual aid complements your presentation.

-   Avoid trying to do too much.
-   Remain consistent in structure and design.
-   Try to avoid skipping slides.
-   Use it to define complex ideas.
-   Show, don't tell.
-   Put the most important info in the top left.

## Visual Aids

The slides give the audience context.

If you want them to pay attention to you, only use images.

## Scenes in a story {.smaller}

```{mermaid}
%%| fig-width: 10
flowchart LR
    A((Premise))
    B((Core Conflict))
    C((Tension))
    D((Turning Point))
    E((Resolution))
    A-->B
    B-->C
    C-->D
    D-->E
```

- **Premise**: What is the donut hole?
- **Core Conflict**: Brief backstory to get audience invested
- **Tension**: What are the implications?
- **Turning Point**: How will we follow to relieve the tension?
- **Resolution**: Resolve the conflict through your *vision*

Your throughline connects the pieces

## And then?

![](images/after.png){fig-align="center"}

## Recap

::: panel-tabset

### Comm App

Learn to manage anxiety by turning irrational fears into rational thoughts.

Apprehension is naturally - channel it!

### Donuts!

Remember the hole in the field that you are trying to fill.

Adapt the content to the audience.

### Performance

Think about how your presentation reflects the identity you want.

Turn your talk into a *story*

# Speaking is hard.

No one expects you to be perfect right away. Embrace the mistakes because theyâ€™ve happened to everyone.
